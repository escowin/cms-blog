## Description

  CMS blog built using MVC & ORM principles.

  I've used bcrypt and dotenv to protect sensitive database & user information. Login sessions are handled with connect-sessions.
  
  Restful API practices allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts & comments. Through insomnia, it is possible to also do the same to user data. However, the app is authguarded to prevent non-users from accessing non-GET routes.
  
  Implemented handlebars.js to render views.

## Languages

  CSS, JavaScript, MySQL
